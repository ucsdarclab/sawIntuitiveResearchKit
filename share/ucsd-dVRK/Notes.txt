1) Foot pedals are connected to MTML NOT MTMR
2) The .cal files were taken from original code base
3) The .xml files (in xmlfiles folder) corresponding to the .cal files were taken from original code base. They should be re-generated and re-calibrated.
4) The rest of the files
	-console-MTMR-PSM1-MTML-PSM2-Telop.json : File that is used for dvrk_robot_console_json to link the tele-op with the arms
	-mtm.json are the kinematics for the master arms
	-psm-large-needle-driver-PSM1.json are the kinematics if you use the needle driver
	-sawControllersPID-XXXX.xml are the xml files for the PID controllers (I guess)
